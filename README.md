# The Sovereign Stack

**Systems Engineering & Architecture Portfolio**
*Author: Andy.M*

## Overview
This repository hosts a collection of low-level engineering projects and benchmarks designed to explore the physical reality of software execution. The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate "Mechanical Sympathy"—the ability to write higher-level software that respects the underlying constraints of the hardware (CPU Caches, Memory Hierarchy, and Data Representation).

Unlike typical application-layer portfolios, this stack focuses on:
* **Zero-Dependency Implementations:** Building core utilities from scratch in C to understand the "Physics of Software."
* **Performance Benchmarking:** Empirical verification of theoretical concepts (e.g., Cache Locality).
* **Robust Systems Programming:** Writing safe, validated, and efficient code that interacts directly with memory.

## Architecture & Modules

### [01-Systems-Programming](./01-Systems-Programming)
Focuses on the interaction between software logic and hardware reality.
* **Key Projects:** CPU Cache Optimization Benchmarks, Low-Level Bitwise Inspection Tools.
* **Core Concepts:** Data Representation, Two's Complement, Cache Lines, Input Validation.

### [02-Memory-Management] (Coming Soon)
* **Focus:** Manual memory allocation, pointer arithmetic, and buffer management.

## Technical Stack
* **Language:** C (C99 Standard)
* **Environment:** Fedora Linux (Virtualization)
* **Compiler:** GCC
* **Version Control:** Git (Feature Branch Workflows)
